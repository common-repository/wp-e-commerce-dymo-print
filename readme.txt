== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is this plugin no longer supported? =
It takes quite some work to add plugins to the WP E-Commerce framework. In more than a year this plugin is not much downloaded, so we don't see reasons to continu development. Besides of that: we love WooCommerce, so see our [WooCommerce DYMO Print plugin!](http://wordpress.geev.nl/product/woocommerce-dymo-print/).
